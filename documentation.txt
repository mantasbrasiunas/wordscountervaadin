What is done
    • Created console version of solution.
    • Created web application version of solution. These bonus objectives 
      were done:
        ◦ Develop a web application wit UI.
        ◦ Upload any number of input files via UI.
        ◦ Display word count results in UI. Show four lists.

Web application version
Source code may be found here (solution with bonus objectives): 
https://bitbucket.org/mantasbrasiunas/wordscountervaadin/src/master/

Command to start aplication: 
mvn clean package jetty:run

Technologies used:
    • Java 16.0.2
    • Vaadin 21.0.1
    • Maven 3.8.2
    • Geany 1.37.1
    • Debian sid
    • Opera 79.0.4143.50
    • Vivaldi 4.3.2431.3 snapshot

Known issues:
    • Can't remove uploaded file from calculations, even X is pressed in Upload 
      component. You must reload whole web application and reupload all files 
      if You uploaded wrong file.
    • Scroll bar won't appear if resizing window.

Limitations and notes:
    • I put a file size limit is    1 * 1024 * 1024 bytes 
      (1’048’576 bytes or 1 MB). It can be changed in source code 
      (MainView.java:80). In more serious application I would put this 
      limitation in properties file.
    • Notification is shown for 10 seconds. It can be changed in source code 
      (MainView.java:23). In more serious application I would put this property 
      in properties file.

Console application version
Source code may be found here:
https://bitbucket.org/mantasbrasiunas/wordscountercli/src/master/

Command to start command line application: 
mvn exec:java

Technologies used:
    • Java 16.0.2
    • Maven 3.8.2
    • Geany 1.37.1
    • Debian sid

Notes:
    • You may write arguments (files names) in pom.xml file.


General notes
    • I know how to use eclipse, but I wanted less help from IDE, because this 
      is my  first project using Vaadin 21. Before I used Vaadin 14.
